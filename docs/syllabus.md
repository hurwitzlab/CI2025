# Applied Cyberinfrastructure 429/529 (3 units)

Asynchronous Online Format; Weekly modules completed at your own pace.
	
## Description of Course

This course provides an introduction to applied cyberinfrastructure in collaboration with a virtual training program with National Science Foundation (NSF) CI Compass. This course has two components: (1) Technical Skills and (2) Data Lifecycle.

The technical skills component provides students with experience in technical skills relevant to cyberinfrastructure (i.e., software engineering, cloud computing, data workflows, etc.).

The data lifecycle component provides students with a contextual understanding of the NSF major facilities (MFs) and related cyberinfrastructure through learning about the data lifecycle of specific MFs and engaging with guest speakers from MFs and the greater cyberinfrastructure community. 

For the class project, students will research a NSF MF to learn about its science mission, cyberinfrastructure, and data lifecycle.

Students work independently online to gain skills in:

Technical Skills:
- the command line
- an overview of scientific computing
- best practices in software development
- cloud computing
- software architecture and systems
- digital archives
- machine learning
- neural networks

Data Lifecycle:
- applied cyberinfrastructure and major facilities
- high-performance computing capabilities through NSF sponsored facilities
- FAIR data
- Professional communication and networking skills

These skills are taught by guest lectures from CI professionals and directors of NSF major facilities, and hands-on learning activities.

## Course Objectives

The course objective is to gain skills in applied cyberinfrastructure through short lectures from CI experts, and hands-on CI skills. This course introduces techniques CI professionals use daily, from how to manage data, to best practices in software development, to systems and methods to scale analyses to meet today's grand challenges with large-scale datasets, cloud-based and high-performance compute architectures, and massive scalable compute. This course teaches students real-world skills in applied CI broadly to advance scientific computing and biological data analysis.

Expected Learning Outcomes
This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of applied cyberinfrastructure. Upon completing this course students will be able to: 

- Be able to describe what cyberinfrastructure (CI) is;
- Understand how CI is used in major facilities to manage data and analyses;
- Work on the command line; 
- Write short Python Programs, work with Jupyter notebooks; 
- Use Git and understand coding standards; 
- Work with containers and debug them; 
- Understand FAIR data principles; 
- Understand architectures and archives; 
- Access and use cloud resources; 
- Create data workflows; 
- Describe challenges in using machine learning, AI and neural networks.

All students will complete a class project to investigate how CI is used in major facilities, and present their findings in a 5 minute lightning talk. Graduate students are required to also submit a Deep Dive in Packback on their class project (that is not required for undergraduates).

## Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course is taught using an asynchronous online format, that allows students to work at their own pace through online lectures and technical & coding exercises in GitHub that demonstrate core concepts. An interactive group discussion (via slack) is available to get help from other students and the instructor. Lectures are complemented with discussions in Packback to ask questions and reinforce concepts from lectures. Technical skills are gained through labs that are available in GitHub. Students will complete a poll in Packback after each lab to give their feedbac and check in on learning. Importantly, because the technical skills in this class build on each other it is essential to complete all lab assignments each week. Assignments (Discussions and Polls) are due at the end of each week on Sundays at 11:59pm. The class project gives the students an opportunity to learn about major facilities (MF) that use cyberinfrastructure at NSF. Students research these MFs and complete a project at the end of the semester. The project is due on the last day of classes (5/7/25) at 11:59pm.  

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

Watching weekly videos and completing technical labs assignments is vital to the class. As such, all assignments are due at the end of the week (Sunday at 11:59 pm). Students who miss assignments due to illness or emergency are required to bring documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant, professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party documentation will result in missing/ungraded assignments for the week.

The UAâ€™s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop 


The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable, http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy.

Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean Designee) will be honored.  See:  https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences  

Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late
Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments/quizzes within the first two weeks of class.
