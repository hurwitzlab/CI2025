# Applied Cyberinfrastructure 429/529 (3 units)

Asynchronous Online Format; Weekly modules completed at your own pace.
	
## Description of Course

This course provides an introduction to applied cyberinfrastructure in collaboration with a virtual training program with NSF CI Compass. This course has two components: 1) a Technical Skills and 2) a Data Lifecycle.

The technical skills component provides students with experience in technical skills relevant to cyberinfrastructure (i.e., software engineering, cloud computing, data workflows, etc.).

The data lifecycle component provides students with a contextual understanding of the NSF major facilities (MFs) and related cyberinfrastructure through learning about the data lifecycle of specific MFs and engaging with guest speakers from MFs and the greater cyberinfrastructure community. 

In groups, students will research a specific MF to learn about its science mission, cyberinfrastructure, and data lifecycle. Students will present on their research findings at the end of the Spring semester via a lightning talk. 

Students work independently and collaboratively online to gain skills in:

Technical Skills:
- the command line
- an overview of scientific computing
- best practices in software development
- cloud computing
- software architecture and systems
- digital archives
- machine learning
- neural networks

Data Lifecycle:
- applied cyberinfrastructure and major facilities
- high-performance computing capabilities through NSF sponsored facilities
- FAIR data
- Professional communication and networking skills

These skills are taught by guest lectures from CI professionals and directors of NSF major facilities, and hands-on learning activities.

## Course Objectives

The course objective is to gain skills in applied cyberinfrastructure through short lectures from CI experts, and hands-on CI skills. This course introduces techniques CI professionals use daily, from how to manage data, to best practices in software development, to systems and methods to scale analyses to meet today's grand challenges with large-scale datasets, cloud-based and high-performance compute architectures, and massive scalable compute. This course teaches students real-world skills in applied CI broadly to advance scientific computing and biological data analysis.

Expected Learning Outcomes
This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of applied cyberinfrastructure. Upon completing this course students will be able to: 

- Be able to describe what cyberinfrastructure (CI) is;
- Understand how CI is used in major facilities to manage data and analyses;
- Work on the command line; 
- Write short Python Programs, work with Jupyter notebooks; 
- Use Git and coding standards; 
- Work with containers and debug them; 
- Understand FAIR data principles; 
- Understand architectures and archives; 
- Access and use cloud resources; 
- Create data workflows; 
- Describe challenges in using machine learning, AI and neural networks.

All students will complete a class project to investigate how CI is used in major facilities, and present their findings in a 5 minute lightning talk. Graduate students are required to submit a Deep Dive in Packback on their class project as well (that is not required for undergraduates).

## Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course is taught using an asynchronous online format, that allows students to work at their own pace through online lectures and technical and coding exercises in GitHub that demonstrate core concepts. An interactive group discussion (via slack) is available to get help from other students and the instructor. Lectures are complemented with discussions in Packback to ask questions and reinforce concepts from lectures. Importantly, because the technical skills in this class build on each other it is essential to complete all assignments each week. Assignments are due at the end of each week on Sundays at 11:59pm. The class project is due on the last day of classes (5/7/25) at 11:59pm.  

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

Watching weekly videos and completing technical assignments is vital to the class. As such, all assignments are due at the end of the week (Sunday at 11:59 pm). Students who miss assignments due to illness or emergency are required to bring documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant, professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party documentation will result in missing/ungraded assignments for the week.

The UAâ€™s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop 


The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable, http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy.

Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean Designee) will be honored.  See:  https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences  

Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late
Students who register after the first class meeting may make up missed assignments/quizzes within the first two weeks of class.

Dispute of Grade Policy: Disputes on a grade for an assignment, quiz, or exam must be made within three days of when the grade is posted.

## Weekly Learning Modules

Each week's learning module consists of: reading assignments, instructional videos, a quiz, and a homework assignment. All practice exercises and homework assignments are on the course GitHub site https://github.com/hurwitzlab/be434-Spring2025 and linked in D2L. All readings, videos, and quizzes are on D2L. 

## Homework

The homework provides you with practice in scripting in Python. Homework is turned in by committing your code to your GitHub repository that is shared with the instructor. Each week's homework is assigned on Monday at 8:00am and due on Sunday at 11:59pm. On the following Monday, the instructor will download your code from GitHub. Your grade will be based on the percentage of tests you pass in the provided test suite with each homework assignment. I encourage group work (via Slack) but be sure the code you turn in has been independently written (see Code of Academic Integrity below). In addition, code should not be written using generative AI resources like ChatGPT, however, you are welcome to use the limited AI recommendations in Replit for correct syntax.

## Quizzes

Each week, you will be tested on the exercises, videos and reading for that week (see the schedule) through a Quiz on D2L. Students can take the quiz up to two times to learn the material and improve their scores.

## Final Project

At the end of the semester, each student will implement a program in Python via the class project that demonstrates the core programming concepts for the class. Students can select from several progamming projects, wherein Graduate students will select from more difficult problems than Undergraduates.
