It brings it's own datatype to the game: an actual array!

The nice thing about software development, when it's done correctly, is that pieces build on top of other pieces. The \"SciPy\" package, for instance, has modules for integration, differentiation, linear algebra (because you can't have too much linear algebra, amiright?), signal processing, image processing (yes, a special case of signal processing)... lots of stuff.  Lots of packages then build on top of SciPy.\n",

Anyway, there is a mostly-complete version of NumPy and SciPy that makes your program use the GPU, at least if it's an Nvidia one. It's called CuPy. For AMD, Intel, and a few other GPUs designers, there is ClPy (that's a lower case \"ell\"). Just switching which packages you import and changing just a little bit you can speed your code up *by several times*.  If your code is doing a lot of linear algebra, for instance (and honestly, *who's isn't?*) then it can make a big difference."
