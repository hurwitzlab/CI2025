Second, when we evaluate a cell and create a variable in it, those variables become available to every cell further down the line. (If you're curious, there is one instance of Python running behind the scenes. Jupyter just crams code into when you execute a cell. When Python is done running that, any output is put into the notebook right below that block. Running another command later, in another cell, sends that code to the one and only Python instance associated with the entire notebook.
